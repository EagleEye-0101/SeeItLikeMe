See It Like Me
==============

This SwiftUI project is designed for the Apple Swift Student Challenge.

Goal
----
The app demonstrates how interface design choices affect accessibility,
comfort, focus, and well-being through short, offline simulations.
It does not provide medical advice or diagnosis.

Structure
---------
- SeeItLikeMeApp.swift: App entry point.
- Core/: Navigation and root content.
- Models/: Simple data models.
- Views/: High-level screens (welcome, selection, final reflection).
- Experiences/: Four interactive experiences.
- Components/: Reusable UI elements.
- Utilities/: Shared helpers for animations and accessibility.

Running
-------
1. Open the `SeeItLikeMe` folder in Xcode or Swift Playgrounds.
2. Build and run on the simulator or a device.
3. Start from the Welcome screen and follow the navigation.

Notes
-----
- The app is fully offline.
- Only SwiftUI and Foundation are used.
- SF Symbols are used for all icons.
- Animations are gentle and avoid flashing patterns.
